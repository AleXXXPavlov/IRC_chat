IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is a real-time communication system over the Internet.

The minimum "logical unit" of IRC is the server. After connecting to the server, you see a list of channels where you can enter. Servers, in turn,  are combined (or linked) among themselves in the network. A network is a collection of servers with a single user and channel 	 namespace.


This project is an implementation of a client with an attempt to improve the unusual design of the last century of the main API.
